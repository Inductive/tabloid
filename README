Reporter allows the creation of cacheable report data using a straightforward DSL and output to formats supported by Ruport.

Creating a report:

class UnpaidClaimsReport < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Reporter::Report

  report_parameter :age_in_days, :required => false, :default => 30
  report_parameter :payers, :required => true
  report_parameter :aging_type, :required => false, :default => :dos

  report :title => "Claims that haven't been paid yet" do
    #can also use a block to define dynamic group
    group :payers, :totals => [ :billed]

    # | Date of Service | Current Payer | Billed Amount | Age in Days |
    # | Payer | Medicare |
    # | 1/1/2011        | Medicare      | $100.00       | 180         |
    group_rows do |payer|
      payer.claims.unpaid
      Payer.execute "select claims.dos, ..."
    end

    element :dos, "Date of Service
    element :current_payer # => column label = "Current payer"
    element :patient_name
    element :billed, "Billed Amount"
    element :age_in_days do |claim|
      Date.today - claim.date_of_service
    end

  end
end
